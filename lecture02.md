# 7/17 lecture about git & github
## take aways:
* **git and general flows**: as simple as a main branch, create a fork to bugfix or add feature, then merge back to main branch to commit changes
* **pull request**: ~~create an *issue*, describe them and comment the difference between the *main branch* and the *pull request* you would like to commit, then create *pull request*. After approved, git push to the *main branch*, or other *desired branch* where you created pull request.~~
pull request is the request you create to ask to merge your changes/commits to the target branch. **And** you can link the issue that talked about your pull request and if it is solved, the issue will closed after the merge of your pull request.
